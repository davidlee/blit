## Ideas

- setting: failed alien human colony planet. Humanity is in a regressive bronze age, barely competing with native alien fauna.
  - depart your village, seek the Ark - the decaying remnants of the ancient colony ship AI.
  - manage your village; plunder dungeons to recover lost knowledge; rebuild the colony ship AI; increase your rank as its chosen.
    - when you die, you are lost, but humanity's outposts, and the colony ship, persist.
  - become a wizard, of sorts - manipulate decaying artefacts, hack fortress networks; study forgotten algorithms and author inventive incantations. Recruit robotic golems.
  - become a superhero, of sorts: gain the security clearance and restore the knowledge to augment your genetics.
  - death can be swift, but each failure marks incremental progress towards your goal.


- alt setting: post apocalyptic Earth; you play a Goblin, attempting to overthrow their Human slavemasters.
- provision and lead a small band of freedom fighters into their lair to rescue other slaves, fight your way deeper into their fortresses
- optional prequel: Papers Please / Man in the High Castle mashup where you play a bureaucrat in the employ of slaver lordlings, attempting to steal and sequester as many resources for the resistance as you can until you are caught and sentenced to death by public torture
