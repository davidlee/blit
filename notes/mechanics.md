# mechanics / design goals for gameplay

# idea:
  - synthesize: 
    - survival/crafting (stick+rock=axe)
    - DF / factorio style industries, stockpiles, workflows
    - a "realistic" economy - trade with other settlements & factions
  - but don't boil the ocean

# goals
- mechanical focus:
  - torchlight-level resource management
  - highly lethal, simulationist turn-based combat
    - stamina and risk-oriented combat choices
    - time-based turns with interruption mechanics
      - choose when to start an action
      - and when to let an opponent move first - wait for them to tire, make a mistake, or overextend
    - reach & positioning are critical
    - Fight! / sword & scoundrel style situationally useful combat choices and manouevres
    - brutal flanking penalties, morale, etc
    - line of sight is not the only fog of war - orientation in melee is combat expertise
    - no HP, only wounds, dismemberment, shock and blood loss, adrenaline, infection and sepsis

# other ideas
- control a party of up to 6 directly; extras (eg. freed captives / villagers) are uncontrolled,
and provide a pool of reinforcements for the dead - veterans have improved morale. discipline, and
awareness in combat, but do little extra to hit or survive being hit - to survive, be the ambusher,
not the ambushed; set traps, skulk, outwit and outflank the enemy. - goblins are weak toe to toe,
but have excellent night vision and a diabolical knack with traps - every rescued captive is another
mouth to feed  ..

- Dwarf-Fortress style indirect control of non-core party - agents have Thoughts, and pursue goal-oriented actions. Your job is to set certain parameters for official duties, and influence through policy and environment design.
- Highly differentiated, uneven characters
 - trait based
 - wide stat system
 - skills, stats improve through use (success + failure) or through time-based training in downtime
