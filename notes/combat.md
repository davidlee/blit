# Time, Movement and Action

so, I have a bold plan: I want to implement "realtime" turn-based combat, and action in general, in
the vein of games like HackMaster.

that is, when you choose an action, you just begin doing something; that something may have several
steps, and may well be interrupted.

Take firing a bow: you must, at a minimum:
 - draw an arrow
 - nock it to the bowstring
 - draw the bow fully
 - aim at your target
 - release the arrow

This is a best-case scenario, and assumes your bow is already strung and in hand; that your target
is relatively still, rather than moving between cover or engaged in a melee; that gusting wind or
the circumstances of battle don't require waiting for a shot to present itself.

Your concentration might be broken by any number of things while all of this occurs, up to and 
including your own beheading.

Rather than a series of immediate actions, chosen with perfect information and enacted as a sequence
of immediate events, in DVERGR skirmishes occur in parallel. 

Knowing what your opponents are trying to do is a great advantage, and the skill in observing them -
or in miscommunicating your own intentions - is a good deal of the difference between a veteran and
a new recruit. Choosing when to act, and when to hold your readiness for a better opportunity, is 
a good deal in deciding who lives to become a veteran.

Movement likewise happens in "real time" - the same currency it takes to swing a sword is spent
to cover ground (influenced by several factors, including your momentum, how careful or conservative
of your stamina you are, and how reckless your disregard for the hazards of a battlefield). It takes 
time also to reach maximum speed, or to change direction once you have. Drawing a dagger can be nearly 
instant, given a free and practiced hand and a well placed sheath, but it takes considerably longer
to rummage through a rucksack or to stow a shield, and armour is best donned with trained assistance
well before hostilities are in train.

Combat is dynamic; standing still is ill-advised, and the careful (and lucky) choice of manouvre and
positioning can make as much difference as the reach of a spear or the bludgeoning mass of a flanged
mace when confronting an armoured foe. Many knights' duels end on the ground in a desperate 
brawl, with a dirk through the slit of a visor or a weakly armoured armpit - but such grappling 
leaves both opponents vulnerable in a general melee. 

It's a rare swordsman who can face down more than one equally defended opponent and live to boast
about it. Being flanked is a death sentence. The only hope in such a situation is to maintain
positioning, and prevent a simultaneous flurry of blows.

Very often, a fight that is not decided in the opening exchanges will go to the man who is fittest, 
or who best chooses how to spend his energies, over-extending his opponent and wearing him down until
his tired arms, or his clumsy footwork, present an opportunity.

Combat is a disorienting, hellish mess; there are no "points" when you score a hit - only shock, 
blood loss, severed limbs, broken morale, trauma, and sepsis. The best way to stay alive is to never
join a fight in which victory is not already assured.
